""" This will be a bad joke maker.
"What is a word that means [word1.definition]
 And can be used to express approval for [word2.definition]?
 That's right, [word1] (mmm,[word2])!"

 Word1 will always begin with 'm'. 
 Word2 is word1 with the 'm' stripped.

 This program should check a dictionary for a word beginning with 'm'.
 When it finds one, it should strip the 'm'
 and see if the remainder is a word in the dictionary.
 If so, it uses it for one of these terrible jokes."""
